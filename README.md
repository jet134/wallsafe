# WallSafe
Wallpaper manager developed specifically for Windows. WallSafe has two key functions: it downloads images from WallHaven and changes your desktop background automatically. You can configure the download and change intervals from seconds to minutes or even hours. Currently WallSafe doesn't download random images but wallpapers specified by keywords. This ensures you'll get wallpapers which are to your liking. On top of that WallSafe can be minimized to system tray, making it completely invisible to user while it's still doing all the work.
