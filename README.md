# WallSafe ![WallSafe Logo](https://github.com/kennyhei/wallsafe/blob/master/src/main/resources/images/wallsafe-icon-round-32-transparent.png)
Wallpaper manager developed specifically for Windows.

WallSafe has two key functions: it downloads images from WallHaven and changes your desktop background automatically. You can configure the download and change intervals from seconds to minutes or even hours. WallSafe downloads wallpapers specified by keywords. This ensures you'll get wallpapers which are to your liking. If no keywords are specified, downloaded images are completely random.  WallSafe can also be minimized to system tray, making it invisible to user while it's still doing all the work.
